# TODO List

## ðŸŸ¢ High Priority

1. **Start using geofences in the background location feature**

   - Integrate geofencing API (e.g., Expo Location or native modules)
   - Trigger events when entering/exiting gym locations
   - Test on both iOS and Android

2. **Implement legend state**

   - Define what "legend" means in your app (criteria, UI, etc.)
   - Add state management for legend status
   - Display legend status in relevant screens

3. **Get streaks working (computed on device, sync streak number to Supabase)**
   - Compute streaks locally based on activity
   - Store only the streak number in Supabase
   - Handle edge cases (missed days, time zones, etc.)
